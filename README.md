# Neural Network

### Background

This begins my training as a data scientist, exploring the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and neural networks. 

This particular neural network classifies the MNIST database, which is a data set that is made up of 60,000 handwritten digits.

This program is able to classify each input from the MNIST database and decide whether the input is a value from (0-9).

### Usage

Click the mouse button to input a random different handwritten digit from the dataset.
The gradient within each card represents a stronger link between the neurons. The darker the color, the stronger the link.
