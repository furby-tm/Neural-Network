# Neural-Network

This begins my training as a data scientist, exploring the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and neural networks. 

This particular neural network classifies the MNIST database, which is a data set that is made up of 60,000 handwritten digits.

This program is able to classify each input from the MNIST database and decide whether the input is a value from (0-9).
